  ## Description
  
  * NoteBOMB! is a web app designed to assist users with keeping track of tasks and other information they need. It acts as a virtual sticky note that users can access whenever they need to save a note or reminder. On page load, any notes the user has saved are accessable on the left side of the screen. New notes can be added and saved by clicking the + and save icons on the upper right of the screen. Once a note is saved, it's moved to the left and can be deleted once it's no longer needed. If a note is deleted it will no longer be available, even after the page has been refreshed.
